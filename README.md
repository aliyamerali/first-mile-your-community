# Your Community

When you join Flatiron School, you join a community. You’ll have the opportunity to work with others and join a rich group of alumni and other developers within the programming community. Below are some details about different ways to access and get involved in our community.

# WeWork - Hot Desk membership

As a Flatiron student, you’ll receive access to a free 12-month [hot desk membership](https://www.wework.com/workspace/hot-desk) to one WeWork location of your choice. During your first week in the program, you’ll learn more about how to sign up for a hot desk and make the most of the community at WeWork.

# Community Slack Channels
Slack is the primary mode of communication for our Learn.co community, and your cohort Slack channel is your homeroom. Important information is posted regularly, so plan to check in daily.

Since students are members of a virtual classroom, our expectation is that each student adds a profile photo of themself and uses their name as Slack username so their classmates will know how to greet them.

You are invited  to join affinity groups and other community-oriented Slack channels. Slack also serves as a tool to raise technical questions, and meet fellow classmates who are at a similar point in the program.  Ask your Educational Coach or fellow students about specific Slack channels to join based on your geographic location, interests, and current progress in the curriculum.
